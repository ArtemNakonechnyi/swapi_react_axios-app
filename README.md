This application is a Star Wars-themed web app that fetches data about characters, planets, and starships from swapi.dev and displays them in card components. The application features a Header component for easy navigation between different types of data, and a Card component for presenting the fetched information. Data is retrieved using an asynchronous function getData from swDataHandler, which handles errors and returns only the necessary fields. The application uses Axios for making API requests, and images for characters are sourced from an external image provider, providing a visually appealing and cohesive design using CSS.
